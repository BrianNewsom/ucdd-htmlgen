Yet another 'tea'-inspired testing frameowrk

# puer.js

- Provide a basic set of 'should' matchers
- Serve as the reference implementation. All matchers are currently implemented using Javascript's regular expression string matching

# puer-cheerio.js

- Re-implement all the matchers
- Use [cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio) to parse and traverse the DOM to perform matching
